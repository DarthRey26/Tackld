You are enhancing a front-end demo for Tackld — a booking platform for service professionals. Your job is to verify that the current implementation satisfies all listed user actions, and add or fix features with proper UI/UX design if not.

🔍 TASK 1: Progress Bar Logic (Customer Side)
A green animated progress bar must:

Appear only when a booking is made.

Start from the left edge of the search bar and end at the right edge of the category dropdown.

Be clickable with stage indicators:

Finding Contractors

Bidding in Progress

Contractor Assigned

Job In Progress

Job Completed

Payment Confirmation

Each stage should:

Include a 5-second delay to simulate real time.

Have a tooltip or modal with short status info when clicked.

Upon job completion, show a “Pay Now” button (simulate payment).

After payment, progress bar disappears and job is moved to History.

🧾 TASK 2: Booking Flow Enhancements
When a customer clicks “Book Service”:

Show a booking form modal or page:

Time/date selector

Upload image (e.g., for cleaning or repairs)

Live image preview

Special notes

“Confirm Booking” button

Add logic: if the customer tries to click out mid-booking, show a warning popup (“Are you sure you want to discard this booking?”).

🧑‍💼 TASK 3: Contractor Side Logic
On receiving a job:

Show job card in New Jobs tab with details and customer image.

Contractor must:

Submit bid with amount and optional message

Wait for customer to accept bid

Once accepted:

Move job to Current Job tab.

Unlock stage controls:

Arrival Confirmation (upload photo)

Midway Check-in (upload photo)

Completion Check (upload photo)

Payment Confirmation (triggered after customer pays)

If contractor clicks out without uploading images or confirming stage → retain job state and restore upon return.

📂 TASK 4: History & Review Tabs
Add “History” tab next to Home and Account buttons for customers.

Shows:

Previous jobs

Dates

Contractors

Images uploaded

Review left or pending

Add “Leave Review” button for completed jobs.

👤 TASK 5: Customer Account Page Additions
Ensure the account page includes:

Name

Profile photo

Preferred service categories

Past booking frequency

Wallet balance + Voucher redemption history

Saved addresses

Contact info (editable)

Toggle: auto-assign contractor / review bids

Notification preferences

Deactivate account

🛠 TASK 6: UX Fail-safes / Break-proofing
Any modal/form (booking, upload, bidding) should:

Prompt confirmation before closing if user input is present.

Retain input if accidentally closed (auto-draft).

No screen should crash or break on:

Back button

Page refresh

Cancel actions

All clickable buttons must:

Have hover/active states

Disable when loading (simulate async loading)

Trigger simulated loading spinners for realism

🎨 TASK 7: UI/UX Polish
Ensure:

Consistent font sizing and colors

Service cards are evenly spaced, mobile responsive

Buttons use shadows and hover effects

Image upload areas use drag-and-drop or file picker

Tooltips and progress indicators use soft animations (Framer Motion or similar)

After implementing, run internal logic checks:

Does the user always know what the next action is?

Can users recover from accidental exits?

Are all buttons, images, and stages connected to an action?
